# Machine Learning with Spark on Google Cloud Dataproc
This is a project based on Spark interactive shell on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster. Code in main.py just demonstrate the commands while pyspark is launched.
***
In this project, I   
create a training dataset for machine learning using Spark.  
Develop a logistic regression machine learning model using Spark.    
Evaluate the predictive behavior of a machine learning model using Spark on Google Cloud Datalab.
